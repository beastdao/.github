# About BEAST
## Intro
BEAST decentralized cooperative is a members-owned initiative to co-create, fund and govern impactful projects. BEAST aims to be as powerful as a16z, as productive as Consensys, as useful as Gnosis, while in the form of a cooperative DAO.

## Mission
BEAST mission is to provide a way for people to work on impactful projects they care about, having access to needed resources, expertise, and connections.

## How we achieve it
To fulfil our mission, we are forming an ever-growing community of technical and non-technical builders set to create infrastructure and public goods for the Web3 and Ethereum ecosystem.

## Values
BEAST principles are inspired by guiding values and principles of cooperatives, Distributed
Autonomous Corporation's characteristics, and nature of web3:

- Equality and equity internally in decision-making (1 member = 1 vote), contributions and compensations of members, as well as externally in any cooperation with 3rd parties
- Member active contribution and economic participation
- Democratic, decentralized & distributed control of the organization by members
- Voluntary, open and global membership
- Concern for members, and our joint results
- Autonomy, independence, and transparency
- Self-sustaining, self-regulating, and incorruptible operations
- Education, information and involvement

# Our Current Projects

Originally, BEAST DAO active contributors decided to build useful tools for web3 users and communities, and started to work on the PoM Protocol (PoM stands for Proof of Membership) and dApp, which were re-branded into 0xNAME for a public launch.

Currently, we already have MULTIPLE connected projects and initiatives: 

## ‚ö´ 0xNAME Protocol and dApp
Digital onchain identity is a right, not a product. Everyone deserves a Web3 name on Ethereum ‚Äî not just those who can pay for it. 0xNAME stands for that.

### The [0xNAME](https://0xname.foo/) Protocol
0xNAME Protocol is a fully decentralised and open authentication system for web3 users and communities, available as a free public good for the benefit of all people and projects in the crypto space.
It enables anyone to seamlessly create FREE personal names (issues as a SoulBound Tokens) with various Top Level Names (TLNs), associated with web3 communities, projects, DAOs, initiatives and so on.

From a technical standpoint, the 0xNAME Protocol is a series of smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, which allows anyone:
- to register and manage registered Top Level Names (TLNs), customise and manage illustrations for Tokens issued with a specific TLN, verify a community/project owning a TLN;
- register personal web3 names, thus creating SoulBound tokens, delete registered personal names, thus destroying SoulBound tokens;
- and search the registry of all TLNs and personal names. 

0xNAME Protocol enables various use cases:
- For web3 users: it empowers a platform - app.0xname.foo - to create FREE personal names perfect for simple transfers, communications, digital identification and more.
- For web3 communities: it provides an ultimate tool, allowing to vote together, to enable token-gated access or to boost members identification using beautiful digital merch and much more!
- For the whole ecosystem: it is a powerful tech backbone enabling new public goods & projects such as, for example, Ethereum Sepolia Faucet empowered by 0xNAMEs and others.

### [0xNAME dApp](https://app.0xname.foo/)
app.0xname.foo is a public good open-source and permissionless dApp (platform) for web3 users to seamlessly create FREE personal web3 names with various TLNs on the Ethereum blockchain.

0xNAMEs are names to receive, issued as non-transferrable Souldbound Tokens on Ethereum. They are FREE, VARIOUS, and YOURS.

Advantages of 0xNAMEs:
- **free to claim and use forever**, because your name, your identity-who you are-is not a product!
- 0xNAMEs are **not transferable**, not separable from you just like your name.
- 0xNAMEs are **as resilient as the Ethereum blockchain**, they are fully onchain.
- 0xNAMEs are **unique and personalised via various TLNs** associated with communities, projects, DAOs, initiatives, events and so on.
- **built for people by people** (BEAST DAO is a decentralised cooperative building public goods in the Web3 space).

For web3 users, free personal names are useful for:‚Ä®
- Transactions: a simple name instead of a long address to receive anything crypto
- Digital identification: unique names as part of their digital identity
- Communications: a personal name for building trust & recognition also in a phygital form soon
and much more.

For web3 communities, it‚Äôs an ultimate tool:
- to vote together
- to enable token-gated access
- to boost members identification using beautiful digital merch
and much more.

## ‚ö´ [0xNAME Resolver Snap](https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/0xname-resolver-snap/)
The 0xNAME Resolver Snap enables resolving of web3 names issued via [app.0xname.foo](https://app.0xname.foo) by a MetaMask wallet. Empowered by the official Snap SDK, it enhances a MetaMask wallet with a single functionality: to seamlessly resolve any 0xNAME web3 names with any custom suffix like alice@eth, yulia@beast or bob@yourdao etc. to their respective Ethereum addresses.
After installing the Snap, simply type any 0xNAME like yulia@beast in the MetaMask send flow instead of long, complex wallet addresses.

## ‚ö´ [Free Faucet - Ethereum Sepolia Faucet written in Rust and powered by 0xNAME](https://faucet.free/)
Powered by 0xNAME, our FREE Sepolia Ethereum Faucet offers the most streamlined Web3 experience ‚Äî no wallet connection, no address copy-paste, just one click.
0xNAME acts as a spam/Sybil prevention layer. So, anyone with any 0xNAME can claim 0.05 Testnet Sepolia ETH every 24 hours without wasting electricity on PoW or holding ETH or ERC-20 tokens.

Our Faucet is an open source WebAssembly web app written in Rust, using dioxuslabs, Fjall, and Alloy. It is smooth, fast, and customizable, so developers enjoy using it, and any project can run its own faucet with ease.

In a long term, we want to build more than just a faucet to fix problems of existing faucets and ways to airdrop any tokens. [faucet.free](https://faucet.free/) is becoming a customizable dispenser for everything crypto ‚Äî built on a modern stack, with dev-first UX. It is an open source, forkable, brandable and flexible tool for the whole industry!
2 Milestones we already achieved:
We redesigned the entire UI ‚Äî focused on clarity, speed, and custom theming. Now anyone can fork, style, or integrate the faucet into their own community or testnet tooling.
We added logs for transparency & debugging and Configurable storage for flexibility. Now anyone can set custom log/db limits with automatic FIFO compaction ‚Äî ensuring stable storage size by pruning stale claims and logs.

## ‚ö´ Snapshot 1 Member - 1 Vote Basic Voting Strategy for 0xNAME(PoM)
We have created a basic voting strategy (‚ÄúPoM Strategy‚Äù), which allows users with a name (0xNAME) in a particular community (TLN) to have 1 vote.
Any community, DAO or project, who set up their Snapshot space for voting, can use this basic strategy as it is, or customise it further.

## ‚ö´ BEAST Digital Badge
All events need name tags or badges for attendees or speakers. Wearable badges could be used by people or event‚Äôs organisers as reusable digital badges displaying various free personal names (issued via 0xname.foo) in various communities attendees or speakers belong to. 1 digital badge = unlimited names and info you can display in line with your needs.
Currently, we have a working prototype of a colourful display (see above) and only we can make updates.
We want to create a self-service tool, so anyone, who have a badge can define names and info (like Linktree) they want to show & quickly update the badge with this info anytime it‚Äôs needed.
