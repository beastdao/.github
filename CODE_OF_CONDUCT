# Contributor Covenant 3.0 Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make our community welcoming, safe, and equitable for all, as well as act in line with values and interests of BEAST DAO decentralised cooperative.

We are committed to fostering an environment that respects and promotes the dignity, rights, and contributions of all individuals, regardless of characteristics including race, ethnicity, caste, color, age, physical characteristics, neurodiversity, disability, sex or gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, language, philosophy or religion, national or social origin, socio-economic position, level of education, or other status. The same privileges of participation are extended to everyone who participates and actively contribute in good faith and in accordance with this Covenant.


## Encouraged Behaviors

While acknowledging differences in social norms, we all strive to meet our cooperative's expectations for positive behavior. We also understand that our words and actions may be interpreted differently than we intend based on culture, background, or native language.

With these considerations in mind, we agree to behave mindfully toward each other as well as toward our joint results or assets and act in ways that center our shared interests and values, including:

1. Respecting the **purpose and goals of our cooperative**, our activities, and our ways of cooperation.
2. **Taking responsibility** for personal actions and contributions.
3. Preferring **value over profit** and **common benefits over personal gains** while executing any tasks.
4. **Acting with integrity** and doing the right things, even if it’s hard.
5. **Treating** our shared results, resources, and assets as well as each other **with care and respect**.
6. Committing to **making no harm and repairing harm** if it occurs.
7. Engaging **kindly and honestly** with others.
8. Respecting **different viewpoints** and experiences.
9. Gracefully giving and accepting **constructive feedback**.
10. Behaving in other ways that promote and sustain the **well-being of our decentralised cooperative and community**.


## Restricted Behaviors

We agree to restrict the following behaviors in our community. Instances, threats, and promotion of these behaviors are violations of this Code of Conduct.

1. **Endangerment.** Causing, encouraging, or threatening harm toward any person, group and assets or results of the decentralised cooperative.
2. **Acting malicious.** Personally or through others executing unethical, fraudulent or malicious actions, which may lead to misuse of or damage to our join results and assets.
3. **Violating confidentiality**. Sharing or acting on someone's personal or private information as well as cooperative's confidential data without permission.
4. **Harassment.** Violating explicitly expressed boundaries or engaging in unnecessary personal attention after any clear request to stop.
5. **Character attacks.** Making insulting, demeaning, or pejorative comments directed at a community member or group of people.
6. **Stereotyping or discrimination.** Characterising anyone’s personality or behavior on the basis of immutable identities or traits.
7. **Sexualization.** Behaving in a way that would generally be considered inappropriately intimate in the context or purpose of the community.
8. Behaving in other ways that **threaten the well-being** of our community.

### Other Restrictions

1. **Misleading identity.** Impersonating someone else for any reason, or pretending to be someone else to evade enforcement actions.
2. **Failing to credit sources.** Not properly crediting the sources of content you contribute.
3. **Promotional materials**. Sharing marketing or other commercial content in a way that is outside the norms of the community.
4. **Irresponsible communication.** Failing to responsibly present content which includes, links or describes any other restricted behaviors.


## Reporting an Issue

Tensions can occur between community members even when they are trying their best to collaborate. Not every conflict represents a Code of Conduct violation, and this Code of Conduct reinforces encouraged behaviors and norms that can help avoid conflicts and minimize harm.

When an incident does occur, it is important to report it promptly. To report a possible violation, **please share an issue, indicating the person and the violation of this Code of Conduct, via** [a dedicated Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/1071459720554098788/1363886680813211880).

Community Moderators (a member from "Operation & Strategy" Committee or a person, responsible for the community management) take reports of violations seriously and will make every effort to respond in a timely manner. They will investigate all reports of Code of Conduct violations, reviewing messages, logs, and recordings, or interviewing witnesses and other participants. Community Moderators will keep investigation and enforcement actions as transparent as possible while prioritising safety and clarity. In order to honor these values, clarifications may be carried out in private with the involved parties, but enforcement actions as well as a resolution will be communicated publicly to the whole community.


## Addressing and Repairing Harm

If an investigation by the Community Moderators finds that this Code of Conduct has been violated, the following enforcement ladder may be used to determine how best to repair harm, based on the incident's impact on the individuals involved and on the decentralised cooperative as a whole. Depending on the severity of a violation, lower rungs on the ladder may be skipped.

1) **Warning**
   1) Event: A violation involving a single incident or series of incidents with low and limited effect.
   2) Consequence: A publicly written warning from the Community Moderators.
   3) Repair: Examples of repair include a publicly written apology, acknowledgement of responsibility, and seeking clarification on expectations.
2) **Temporary Suspension**
   1) Event: A pattern of repeated violations with low effect which the Community Moderators have tried to address with warnings, or a single serious violation.
   2) Consequence: A publicly written warning with conditions for return from suspension. In general, temporary suspensions give the person being suspended time to reflect upon their behavior and possible corrective actions.
   3) Repair: Examples of repair include respecting the spirit of the suspension, making an apology publicly, meeting the specified conditions for return, and being thoughtful about how to reintegrate with the community when the suspension is lifted.
3) **Permanent Ban**
   1) Event: A pattern of repeated Code of Conduct violations that other steps on the ladder have failed to resolve, or a violation so serious that the Community Moderators determine there is no way to keep the community and the decentralised cooperative safe with this person as a member.
   2) Consequence: Access to all community spaces, tools, and communication channels is removed. In general, permanent bans should have strong reasoning behind them.
   3) Repair: There is no possible repair in cases of this severity.

This enforcement ladder is intended as a guideline. It does not limit the ability of Community Moderators to use their discretion and judgment, in keeping with the best interests of our decentralised cooperative and community.


## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community and decentralised cooperative spaces and tools, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the decentralised cooperative in public or other spaces. Examples of representing our decentralised cooperative include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
